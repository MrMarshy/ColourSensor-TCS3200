### Colour Sensors

- Used to distinguish colour mixtures of red, blue and green.
- Used in industrial process and quality control.
- Useful in specialized lighting and photography applications.
- Outputs can be digital, analog or variable frequency.
- Sensors consits of an arrays of photodiodes.
- Separate array for each colour.
- Arrays are addressed individually.
- Photodiodes sensitivity changes with colour therefore the output for each colour is non-linear.
- Output is not an RGB value.
- Sensor calibration required to get RGB.
- Some sensors also sense infrared light.
